# Project Roadmap


## Improvements
### 1. API Response Format and Error Handling
Prefer to use packages like Fractal(https://fractal.thephpleague.com/) to follow the response format of JSON API Spec. And handling the generic errors and exceptions from middleware. 
    
### 2. Error Reporting And Logging
Prefer to integrate error reporting packages like Sentry (https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/) for easier troubleshooting and debugging.
